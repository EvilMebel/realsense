Intel Realsene SDK using Opencv from PXCImage to Mat variable
=================================================================

Realsense_opencv for the Intel RealSense SDK and hardware, based on Intel Realsense Camera (https://github.com/dthepok/realsense).

Currently Supported:
* Color Stream stored in Mat Variable
* Depth Stream stored in Mat Variable

This should be considered experimental and unfinished until some sort of official v1.0-ish announcement.  Expect to see parity with the current RealSense SDK.  If there's a specific feature you need right away, please let me know.

Thanks !!
